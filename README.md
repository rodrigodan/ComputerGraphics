# OpenGl - Computer Graphic's projects

<h5>A repository for Computer Graphic Assignment and projects</h5>

## Getting Started:

<p>Each module above, is an assitment or project of computer graphics using openGL and its libaries and API.</p>
<p>Every installation process of demanded tool to run files within these modules is explained in following steps using Ubuntu and in some cases Windows. </p>

### Modules:

#### OpenGL-Beginning (module 01):

<p> This module has a simple application, just to understand how openGl and its libraries work.</P>
<p> OpenGl is a standard application programming interface(API) with cross-language and cross-platform features for rendering 2d and 3d applications.</p>
<p> OpenGl is responsible in most cases for drawing content on window using primitives(polygon triangles points quadrilateral,...)</p>
<p> Where for these graphic contents, It is necessary to use utilities for openGl to allow some behaviours, like: window definition, window control and monitoring of keyboard and mouse input.</p>
<p> Thus, one toolkit that makes it, is GLUT(OpenGL Utility Toolkit) that is labrary utilities for openGl.</p>
<p> However GLUT is a not openSource tool, then, instead of using GLUT, in this project, will be used freeglut.</p>
<p> To know what you need to install in this module, read the section 1.0.

#### installation requirements (section 1.0): 

To run files from this module, you need to install at the beginning the C and C++ compilers called gcc and g++ respectively, OpenGL and the freeglut that is a free-software/open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library.

#### How to run it?

<p> After making sure what is openGL, GLUT and what you need to install on your computer tu run this application, let's start.</p>
<p> Open your terminator, go to the folder OpenGL-Beginning and type the following command: </p>

```
make
```

<p> After this, run the generated object file using the command:</p>

```
./glstar
```
#### Result:
